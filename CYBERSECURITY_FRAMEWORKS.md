# Comprehensive Cybersecurity Frameworks Guide (2025)

This guide provides an overview of the most critical and widely adopted cybersecurity frameworks, updated for the 2025 landscape.

## 🏛️ General Security Management

### 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
*   **Source**: National Institute of Standards and Technology (US)
*   **Focus**: A flexible, risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity.
*   **Key Update (2.0)**: Added a sixth core function, **"Govern"**, to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Expanded scope beyond critical infrastructure to all organizations.
*   **Best For**: Building a holistic cybersecurity program from the ground up or maturing an existing one.

### 2. ISO/IEC 27001:2022
*   **Source**: International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
*   **Focus**: Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). A formal standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving information security.
*   **Key Feature**: Rigorous certification process often required for vendor risk management in enterprise deals.
*   **Best For**: demonstrably proving security maturity to partners/customers and achieving rigorous compliance.

### 3. CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) v8
*   **Source**: Center for Internet Security
*   **Focus**: Prioritized, prescriptive set of actions to defend against common cyber attacks.
*   **Key Feature**: Organized into Implementation Groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) to guide organizations of different maturity levels.
*   **Best For**: Practical, actionable "to-do" lists for technical defenses; great for effective baseline security.

## ⚔️ Threat & Defense Operations

### 4. MITRE ATT&CK
*   **Source**: MITRE Corporation
*   **Focus**: Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. Knowledge base of adversary behaviors.
*   **Key Feature**: Maps real-world attack behaviors (e.g., "Phishing", "Credential Dumping") to detection and mitigation strategies.
*   **Best For**: Threat hunting, Red Teaming, improving detection coverage, and SOC operations.

### 5. Cyber Kill Chain
*   **Source**: Lockheed Martin
*   **Focus**: Breakdown of the phases of a cyberattack (Reconnaissance to Actions on Objectives).
*   **Best For**: Understanding the linear progression of an attack interception.

## ☁️ Cloud & Service Security

### 6. SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)
*   **Source**: AICPA
*   **Focus**: Auditing standard for service organizations (like SaaS) regarding Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.
*   **Best For**: SaaS companies needing to prove trustworthiness to enterprise clients.

### 7. CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
*   **Source**: Cloud Security Alliance
*   **Focus**: Fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud provider.

## ⚖️ Regulatory & Privacy

### 8. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
*   **Focus**: Data privacy and protection for individuals within the European Union.
*   **Key Feature**: Strict mandates on data processing, consent, and breach notification with heavy fines for non-compliance.

### 9. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
*   **Focus**: Protection of sensitive patient health information (PHI) in the US.
*   **Key Feature**: Security Rule (technical safeguards) and Privacy Rule (use and disclosure of PHI).

### 10. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) v4.0
*   **Focus**: Security of credit card transactions and cardholder data.
*   **Key Feature**: Prescriptive technical and operational requirements for anyone handling card payments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Models

### 11. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
*   **Core Principle**: "Never Trust, Always Verify." Remove implicit trust based on network location.
*   **Key Components**: Least privilege access, micro-segmentation, and continuous authentication.
*   **Reference**: NIST SP 800-207.

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### 12. FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
*   **Focus**: Quantifying information risk in financial terms.
*   **Best For**: Translating cyber risk into business language ($) for executive decision-making.

---
**Note**: Choosing the right framework depends on your industry, size, and regulatory requirements. Most mature organizations use a "hybrid" approach, mapping controls from one (e.g., CIS) to the compliance requirements of another (e.g., NIST or ISO).
